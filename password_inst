cdMany companies have password requirements (must include a letter, a number and a symbol for example and require a password of a specific length). We're going to write a program that will read in a proposed password and only accept it, if it meets all rules.

Create a program that will:

Prompt a user for input (for a new password)
Read in the proposed Password to a variable
If the password contains a number and a symbol (@: 64, %: 37, *: 42, or !:33) and contains 8 or more characters then accept the password and congratulate the user, if not make them reenter the password until they enter an acceptable password
[Optional] Make the user enter the password a second time to verify, and if it's not the same as the original password, make them repeat the process
[Optional] Make them include a capital and a lowercase letter
[Optional] Let them know what they did wrong
